I’m a dedicated MERN stack developer and lifelong learner, crafting user-centered, scalable, and responsive web applications. Before transitioning into tech, I spent over a decade as a sound technician and DJ — a journey that shaped my creativity, attention to detail, and ability to perform under pressure. Today, I blend those strengths with modern technologies like MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to build seamless end-to-end solutions, from intuitive front-end interfaces to robust back-end APIs.
